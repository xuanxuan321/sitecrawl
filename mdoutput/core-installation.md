# Installation & Setup (2023 Edition)
## 1. Basic Installation
```
pip install crawl4ai
Copy
```

This installs the **core** Crawl4AI library along with essential dependencies. **No** advanced features (like transformers or PyTorch) are included yet.
## 2. Initial Setup & Diagnostics
### 2.1 Run the Setup Command
After installing, call:
```
crawl4ai-setup
Copy
```

**What does it do?** - Installs or updates required browser dependencies for both regular and undetected modes - Performs OS-level checks (e.g., missing libs on Linux) - Confirms your environment is ready to crawl
### 2.2 Diagnostics
Optionally, you can run **diagnostics** to confirm everything is functioning:
```
crawl4ai-doctor
Copy
```

This command attempts to: - Check Python version compatibility - Verify Playwright installation - Inspect environment variables or library conflicts
If any issues arise, follow its suggestions (e.g., installing additional system packages) and re-run `crawl4ai-setup`.
* * *
## 3. Verifying Installation: A Simple Crawl (Skip this step if you already run `crawl4ai-doctor`)
Below is a minimal Python script demonstrating a **basic** crawl. It uses our new **`BrowserConfig`**and**`CrawlerRunConfig`**for clarity, though no custom settings are passed in this example:
```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.example.com",
        )
        print(result.markdown[:300])  # Show the first 300 characters of extracted text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**Expected** outcome: - A headless browser session loads `example.com` - Crawl4AI returns ~300 characters of markdown.  
If errors occur, rerun `crawl4ai-doctor` or manually ensure Playwright is installed correctly.
* * *
## 4. Advanced Installation (Optional)
**Warning** : Only install these **if you truly need them**. They bring in larger dependencies, including big models, which can increase disk usage and memory load significantly.
### 4.1 Torch, Transformers, or All
  * **Text Clustering (Torch)**  

```
pip install crawl4ai[torch]
crawl4ai-setup
Copy
```

Installs PyTorch-based features (e.g., cosine similarity or advanced semantic chunking).
  * **Transformers**  

```
pip install crawl4ai[transformer]
crawl4ai-setup
Copy
```

Adds Hugging Face-based summarization or generation strategies.
  * **All Features**  

```
pip install crawl4ai[all]
crawl4ai-setup
Copy
```



#### (Optional) Pre-Fetching Models
```
crawl4ai-download-models
Copy
```

This step caches large models locally (if needed). **Only do this** if your workflow requires them.
* * *
## 5. Docker (Experimental)
We provide a **temporary** Docker approach for testing. **It’s not stable and may break** with future releases. We plan a major Docker revamp in a future stable version, 2025 Q1. If you still want to try:
```
docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
docker run -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
Copy
```

You can then make POST requests to `http://localhost:11235/crawl` to perform crawls. **Production usage** is discouraged until our new Docker approach is ready (planned in Jan or Feb 2025).
* * *
## 6. Local Server Mode (Legacy)
Some older docs mention running Crawl4AI as a local server. This approach has been **partially replaced** by the new Docker-based prototype and upcoming stable server release. You can experiment, but expect major changes. Official local server instructions will arrive once the new Docker architecture is finalized.
* * *
## Summary
1. **Install** with `pip install crawl4ai` and run `crawl4ai-setup`. 2. **Diagnose** with `crawl4ai-doctor` if you see errors. 3. **Verify** by crawling `example.com` with minimal `BrowserConfig` + `CrawlerRunConfig`. 4. **Advanced** features (Torch, Transformers) are **optional** —avoid them if you don’t need them (they significantly increase resource usage). 5. **Docker** is **experimental** —use at your own risk until the stable version is released. 6. **Local server** references in older docs are largely deprecated; a new solution is in progress.
